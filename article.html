    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">Ethical Use of AI</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left; color: white;">In Academics</h3>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">
      Students and teachers are both reminded of the use of GenAI whether they like it or not. Engaging with GenAI means having an assistant tool that will help students accomlish assignments, but teachers also keep note on how they use it, and consider how students try to engage in those activities.

      Not all applications give benefit, though, as some impose risk of harm to students than others (Gasevic et al., 2023).
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left; color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">Avoiding Misuse and Plagiarism</h3>
    <pre style="color: white;">
        As you already know, plagiarism is considered unethical in all organizations in research, and this is evident in GenAI. There is potential for misuse of GenAI to create essays and papers they haven't authored, plagiarizing existing works or claiming AI-generated content as their own.
        
        Teachers have to be careful of questioning students in the misuse of GenAI, as this may damage the reputation of the student. It always follows with these guidelines:
    </pre>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Equity - GenAI is available, but only in select countries, and some require people to pay for subscription (either premium or legacy). Biased data may make AI perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Privacy Concerns - AI needs data on the students, which may include demographic information. teachers must watch out as there should be balance in between making decisions with AI and real people for their privacy.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Algorithm Discrimination -  </li>
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Efficacy - if left unchecked, misuse of AI in education could bring severe harm if this data isn't accurate. Relying on AI without considering its limits can be counter-productive.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Authorship - the use of AI raises questions about ownership of AI-generated content. both students and teachers must be aware and clear on citing works created by AI, otherwise their integrity would be at risk.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Appropriate Use - teachers and policymakers are responsible for making rules on AI usage to their institution. Those guidelines can help expand innovation of the students rather than shortening it.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left; color: white;">Accuracy and Verification of AI-generated Content</h3>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">
      Sometimes, GenAI can give the wrong answer, like a factual error, or incomplete information ommitted to the user.
      AI can also give people false information, or simply, something that does not exist today.
      AI does not produce its own sources accurately, because some results are very unlikely to be where it is pulling that information. They can get those data from different webpages and provide the same exact answer but footnot different sources.
      And finally, they sometimes ignore instructions or interpret the prompt you typed in an unexpected way. They can also make interpretations that users do not want.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left; color: white;">The Fairness and Biases of AI</h3>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">
      Fairness is ensuring that systems operate properly. People should take responsibly for the use of Ai in everything: transaction, conversations, work, etc.
      It is important that everyone follows the rules and be aware of these statements:
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Customer service chatbots provide consistent and unbiased support.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">AI algorithms recommend products fairly.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Loan approvals are based on impartial financial factors.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Healthcare diagnoses and treatment recommendations are equitable.</li>
      </ul>
      There are also AI biases (those can be interpreted as systematic errors) that are presents in AI-generated content, such as:
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Sampling/representation bias (incomplete or unepected output)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Confirmation bias (sometimes taken from conspiracy)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Measurement bias (different data structure from the actual variables)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Stereotyping bias (towards gender, race, and other factors)</li>
      </ul>
      Because of this, AI bias can be unintentional, where as AI fairness is inherently deliberate and intentional.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left; color: white;">What are those guidelines that I recommend?</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Always be aware of your actions, especially when you use Ai for the first time.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Consider lower grades when you use too much AI.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Seek help from your teacher and ask if you may use it.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" style="color: white; background-color: transparent; word-wrap: break-word;">Know what is right and what is wrong, and know when to stop.</li>
      </ul>
